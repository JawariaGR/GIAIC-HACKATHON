# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: An AI-Driven Textbook

Welcome to the official repository for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook.

This project is an AI-driven textbook designed for students and enthusiasts learning about embodied intelligence. The book explains how digital AI models interact with the physical world through humanoid robots, with a focus on practical application and hands-on learning.

## About This Book

This book uses a modular, 13-week structure to guide you from the fundamentals of ROS 2 to building complex Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems. You will learn to work with industry-standard tools like:

-   **ROS 2 (Humble)**: The Robot Operating System.
-   **Gazebo & Unity**: For physics simulation and creating digital twins.
-   **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: For advanced perception, AI, and robotics simulation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the setup and installation, please refer to the guide at `specs/1-textbook-outline/quickstart.md`.

## Project Structure

-   `/book`: Contains the markdown files for each chapter, organized by module.
-   `/simulations`: Contains simulation assets, such as Gazebo worlds and URDF files.
-   `/specs`: Contains the project planning and specification documents.

We hope you enjoy learning about the exciting world of physical AI!
