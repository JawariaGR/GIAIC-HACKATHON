# Conclusion: The Future of Physical AI

Congratulations on completing this journey into the world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! You have built a solid foundation in ROS 2, simulation, perception, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

The field of robotics is evolving at an incredible pace. The concepts and skills you have learned in this book are the building blocks for creating the next generation of intelligent robots that can interact with the physical world in meaningful ways.

We encourage you to continue exploring, experimenting, and contributing to the open-source robotics community. The future of robotics is in your hands!
